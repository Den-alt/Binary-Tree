# Binary-Tree

Condition: 1 - data to be read from files and entered into tree nodes, 
and a sign (condition) for ordering nodes;
2 - the order of traversing the tree to print its elements (data in nodes); 
3 - actions to be performed on the elements of the tree; 
4 - the order of wiping the nodes for complete removal of wood; 
5 - the purpose of the function to be implemented without the use of recursion. 

*Task:*

1) sequence of real numbers (two digits in the whole part, one in fractional) - ordering by values of numbers; 
2) lower (from the leaves) from left to right;
3) 
    1) calculate the average value of all elements of the tree; 
    2) print the nodes located on each of the levels of the tree;
4) straight (from the root) from right to left; 
5) calculation of the average value of all nodes.
